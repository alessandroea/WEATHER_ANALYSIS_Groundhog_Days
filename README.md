# WEATHER_ANALYSIS_Groundhog_Days
### An analysis of the NCEI Hourly Precipitation Data, dowloaded from: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/coop-hourly-precipitation/v2/

Main tasks for this analysis:

* Create a graphical representation of average total rainfall by month for all the years covered by the
  dataset. Include an indication of the variation in the data for each month.

* Groundhog Day is 2 Feb. Determine which, if any, Groundhog Days in the dataset were outliers in terms of the
  recorded rainfall and explain how you reached your conclusions.

* Punxsutawney Phil is summoned from his burrow at around 07:25 every Groundhog Day. Calculate the probability
  that he will get wet when he emerges. How does that probability change (if at all) if we know that it rained
  on the previous day?

* Analyse the dataset for any evidence of trends in rainfall amount over time. Present your findings graphically
  and explain how you reached your conclusions.
